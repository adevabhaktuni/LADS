Deisotoper + LADS

Developed by Arun Devabhaktuni and the Elias Lab at Stanford University.

SUPPORTED OS:
- Any linux platform with BASH and Python installed. 

REQUIREMENTS:
- Python 2.6 or greater
- Python-dev(el) installed
- Sudo privileges may be necessary

PACKAGE INCLUDES:
- Bash script to install necessary third party libraries for LADS
- Bash script to run both deisotoper and LADS together
- Deisotoper with mzxml functionality
- LADS
- Libsvm source code
- Python NUMPY source code
- Python NetworkX source code
- Test data set with DTAs and test mzXML (only contains ms2 peaks)

TO CONFIGURE:
To configure, enter the collowing command:

sh config.sh 

with root access. This will unpack necessary files. If you do not have python
installed, it will error out and tell you that it is needed to use our 
software.  

TO RUN:
To run, enter the following command:

sh wrap.sh -d INPUT -o OUTPUT -l MS_LEVEL (optional) -r RESTRICTIONS (optional)

where -d is the input mzXML file, -o is the desired return directory for LADS
and LADS scoring, -l related so the MS level that deisotoper will search for,
and -r is the single piece that you wish to run (optional). Input must be entered
with full path. By default, if no output directory is given, this script will 
default to storing all DTAs and LADS output files to the input directory. 
If the MS level is not specified, then it will default to MS2. 
Writing to this directory will require write permissions, and in case you
encounter a warning saying that no such directory existed, please run under
eleveated access. 

Possible MS levels:
	1 = MS1
	2 = MS2
	3 = MS1 + MS2
	4 = MS3
	5 = MS1 + MS3
	6 = MS2 + MS3
	7 = MS1 + MS2 + MS3

	Possible restrictions with -r:
	deisotope = Only run deisotoper
	lads = Only run LADS search
	score = Only run LADS scoring function

FOR HELP:
Enter:

sh wrap.sh -h

TO MODIFY RUNS:
Change the wrap.sh file to modify the parameters that you wish to use on either
deisotoper or LADS. To view the help menus, type "sh wrap.sh HELP". Modifying 
parameters will need to be done within the wrap.sh script for each individual
program. 

NOTE:
Current scripts are set up with relative paths which are based on the current
extracted organization. Moving files to different directories will cause 
scripts to break. 

Sample data has been packaged with the executables to help in verification that
all programs function properly. For the deisotoper, there is a test mzXML file that
unpacks to ~13,000 dta files. For LADS, a test set of dtas at ~620. For LADS
scoring, a test run through the test dtas provided. 

TO RUN DEISOTOPER INDEPENDENTLY:
Run the following command within the deisotoper directory:

php deisotoper_mzxml_conversion.php -n -f $INPUT -o $TMP -l $LEVEL

where -f represents the input mzXML file, -o represents the output directory where
the returned dta files will be returned, and -l represents the desired scan
levels that will be extracted.

TO RUN LADS INDEPENDENTLY:	
Run the following command:

sh wrap.sh -d INPUT -o OUTPUT -l MS_LEVEL (optional) -r RESTRICTIONS (optional)

where -d is the input directory for all DTA files to be used in the search,
-o is the output directory where output.txt will be stored, and -r is is "lads".
NOTE: only the input, output, and output for tee should be changed as all other
parameters are used for various portions of LADS. Removal of these arguments
will cause the program to crash.

TO RUN LADS SCORING INDIVIDUALLY:
Run the following command:

sh wrap.sh -d INPUT -o OUTPUT -l MS_LEVEL (optional) -r RESTRICTIONS (optional)

where -d is the directory in which the LADS search output is, -o is the desired
directory for scoring output, and -r is "score".
